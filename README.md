Alphabet Soup

Everyone loves alphabet soup.  And of course, you want to know if you can construct a message from the letters found in your bowl. Your Task: Write a function that takes as input two strings:
1. The message you want to write
2. All the letters found in your bowl of alphabet soup.
Assumptions:
* It may be a very large bowl of soup containing many letters.
* There is no guarantee that each letter occurs a similar number of times - indeed some letters might be missing entirely.
* The letters are ordered randomly.
